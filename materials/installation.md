# Python Elective at KEA CS fall 2019

# Installation
1. Install Python, VS Code, Git and create a GitHub account.

## 1. Python
### Download and install Python
* Download and install Python from the following source 
    * https://www.python.org/downloads/
* During instalation on Windows, make sure to ``` âˆš ``` the option ``` Add Python 3.7 to PATH ```  
#### Check if everything is installed
* Open you Terminal (mac) PowerShell (windows) and type in the following

````
python3 --version
````

When pressing enter, you should now see the following

````
python3 --version
Python 3.7.4
````
If you see something else, python is not installed correct, and you should try again.  

On Windows (if you did not previously install python) you will be able to type ``` python ``` instead of ``` python3 ```.

````
  python --version
  Python 3.7.4
````
On Mac you will have to follow these steps in order for it to work:    
[Special for Mac OS: Create an alias python/python3](mac_alias.md)  


## 2. VS Code
### Download and install the text editor VS Code
* Download and install VS Code from the following source 
    * https://code.visualstudio.com/


## 3. Git & Github
### Download and install Git
* If you do not already have git installed on your computer you should do this before we meet. https://git-scm.com/ 

_If you are on **Windows** be sure to install the "Git Bash" (this is an option you can choose during the installation process.)_

#### Check if everything is installed
* Open you terminal and type in the following


````
git --version
````
When pressing enter, you should now see the following

````
git --version
git version 2.10.1  // or some other version number
````

If you see something else, Git is not installed correct, and you should try again.


## 4. Create a Github Account
* If you do not already have a GitHub account, you should create one now. 
    * Go to https://github.com/ and create an account 
    * Get a [Github Education Account](https://education.github.com/) (Here you get free private repositories)

## Installation help
In most cases the installation process is straight forward. In some cases the ``` --vesion ``` on git and python3 could fail if the path is not set correct.
